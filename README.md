# PixelfixCPP
[Pixelfix](https://github.com/Corecii/Transparent-Pixel-Fix/tree/master) rewritten in C++ for use in processing images before uploading to Roblox. The original was too slow for larger images and processing a large number of images at once; the new version is significantly quicker.

## Build
Compile however you like. There are no extra libraries or anything. Build however you want.
